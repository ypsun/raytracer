  CSC418 - RayTracer code - Winter 2017 - Assignment 3&4

  RayTracer header file. Structure and data definitions.
  F.J. Estrada, Dec. 9, 2010

  Goal is to make this code as simple and fast as possible...

  You DO NOT need to modify this file, but you DO NEED to
  read and understand what it does.

   The structures below are used to define an object colour in terms of the
   components of the Phong illumination model. Note that we typically
   define colours together with objects, so you should not need to
   instantiate lone instances of the colour structure.

   Also, note that you can easily make your objects completely white
   (or completely monochromatic) by not being careful how the different
   components in the Phong model add up. Take a moment and think how
   you want your object to look before you set these values.

   The structure below defines an Object within the World Coordinate Frame.
   For this ray tracer, we will use a simple linked list of objects (not
   a tree structure, so hierarchical transformations have to be fully
   specified). This is not really limiting and simplifies the data
   structure to hold the scene.

   Note that the Object3D structure is completely agnostic about the type
   of object defined, the difference is made by the intersect function.
   If you think carefully about it, in terms of raytracing objects are
   defined entirely by their surface, and the surface is defined in the
   intersect function for each object.

   Thus, to create additional objects, simply provide a suitable
   intersection function. The rest stays the same.
